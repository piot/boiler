# ðŸš‚ Boiler

Build your game without leaving your command line.

This tiny CLI takes your prebuilt binaries from GitHub releases, downloads game content and prepares depots.
Itâ€™s perfect for when youâ€™re too busy making your game to remember what the .vdf files even does.

## ini file

```ini
steam_app_id 1234560

binaries {
    repo "game-engine/engine" # github repo
    name executable_name
    version "0.1.2"

    macos {
        depot 1234562
    }

    windows {
        depot 1234563
    }

    linux {
        depot 1234564
    }

    depot 1234561

    repo yourgame/contents # github repo

    # what directories to copy to the build directory
    directories ["assets", "scripts", "packages"] 
}
```
